Introduction
============

nimbus is a build system for `Nim`_. It is compatible with the `Nimble`_ package
format, so you can use it to build and install packages from the `Nimble
Directory`_ and other sources.

Raison d'Ãªtre
-------------

nimble is a great tool for development but it does not get on well with system
package managers. This project is intended to be used with traditional package
managers (primarly with Gentoo's Portage). But maybe it'll be useful for other
purposes too.
