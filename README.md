nimbus
======

**nimbus** is a **Nim** **bu**ild **s**ystem. You can also call in NimBS. Nimja
would also be a clever name but it's already taken (turns out the name "nimbus"
is taken two times already but nobody cares yet).

[Read the manpage online][man]

[man]: https://docs.sysrq.in/nimbus


Raison d'Ãªtre
-------------

[nimble](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble) is a great tool for development but
it does not get on well with system package managers.

This project is intended to be used with traditional package managers (primarly
with Gentoo's Portage). But maybe it'll be useful for other purposes too.


Dependencies
------------

**nimbus** only generates `build.ninja` files, so you'll need [ninja][ninja]
or [samurai][samurai] to use it.

If you want depfile support (`--useDepfile` flag), build Nim with my
[nim-patches][nim-patches].

[ninja]: https://ninja-build.org/
[samurai]: https://github.com/michaelforney/samurai

[nim-patches]: https://git.sysrq.in/nim-patches/


Installing
----------

* Using nimble:

    `nimble install`

* Using just Nim compiler:

    `nim c src/nimbus`


Testing
-------

```sh
$ testament all
```
