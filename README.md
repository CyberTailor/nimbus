nimbus
======

**nimbus** is a **Nim** **bu**ild **s**ystem. You can also call in NimBS. Nimja
would also be a clever name but it's already taken.


Raison d'Ãªtre
-------------

[nimble](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble) is a great tool for development but
it does not get on well with system package managers.

This project is intended to be used with traditional package managers (primarly
with Gentoo's Portage). But maybe it'll be useful for other purposes too.


Dependencies
------------

**nimbus** only generates `build.ninja` files, so you'll need [ninja][ninja]
or [samurai][samurai] to use it.

[ninja]: https://ninja-build.org/
[samurai]: https://github.com/michaelforney/samurai


Installing
----------

* Using nimble:

    `nimble install`

* Using just Nim compiler:

    nim c src/nimbus


Testing
-------

```sh
$ testament all
```
